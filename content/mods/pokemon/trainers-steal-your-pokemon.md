At the start of every battle, opponents randomly take a Pokémon from your party and add it to their team.

# Difficulty Settings

<b>Soft:</b> Trainers give you one Pokémon from their team after battle. There's a small chance they return your Pokémon back to you.

<b>Hard:</b> Trainers do not give Pokémon back to you after battle.

<b>Hardcore:</b> Hard, plus the price of Poké Balls increases by $250 Poké Dollars with every gym badge (which makes losing Pokémon more costly).

# Notes

If you hate grinding, visit the clerk in the first town's Poké Mart for some helpful items.

In the 'Hard' and 'Hardcore' modes, there is a randomly determined order in which your Pokémon will be stolen. The next Pokémon to be stolen will appear in black in the party menu. 

In order to mitigate accidental softlocks, any Pokémon can learn any HM.
