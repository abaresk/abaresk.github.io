Your Poké Balls are made of lead -- your Pokémon are permanently damaged by lead poisoning both in and out of battle. If your Pokémon actually gets poisoned, it takes double damage.

Unlike regular poison, lead poisoning will also affect Steel- and Poison-type Pokémon. 

Too easy? Try beating it without using healing items!
