Your Poké Balls are made of lead!
Your Pokémon permanently take poison damage both in and out of battle.
If your Pokémon actually gets poisoned, it takes double damage.

Note that unlike real poison, lead poisoning affects Steel- and Poison-type Pokémon. 

Too easy? Try beating it without using healing items!
