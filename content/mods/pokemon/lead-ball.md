Your Poké Balls are made of lead -- your Pokémon permanently take poison damage both in and out of battle. If your Pokémon actually gets poisoned, it takes double damage.

Unlike real poison, lead poisoning affects Steel- and Poison-type Pokémon. 

Too easy? Try beating it without using healing items!
