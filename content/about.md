Hello, welcome to my personal blog! I'm mostly using this as a forum to talk about hobbies and things that I find interesting. For me, that's mostly games and music, but perhaps it will include random other ventures as well. I hope you'll enjoy reading :)

For fun, I like to make mods of older video game titles. I've compiled these under the "Mods" section of the page. Feel free to take a look and play if any interest you.

For those interested, the username "Abaresk" comes from an old [song](https://youtu.be/XMVmQAW0CM8) that I enjoy. In fact, when making the abacus logo for this site, I tried to encode in it some notes from the original piece.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or suggestions at abaresk01@gmail.com.
