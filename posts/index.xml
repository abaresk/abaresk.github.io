This setup has helped me both understand how undocumented parts of the games work and also create the mods on this site. Hopefully sharing this helps others looking to do the same.
This setup is compatible with the pokeruby, pokefirered, and pokeemerald projects on Linux, MacOS, or WSL.
VSCode VSCode offers a great interface for debugging code. The experience is streamlined into the code editor and uses the source code to provide useful context while debugging.</description></item></channel></rss>
