Difficulty Settings Soft: Trainers give you one Pokémon from their team after battle. There&amp;rsquo;s a small chance they return your Pokémon back to you.
Hard: Trainers do not give Pokémon back to you after battle.
Hardcore: Hard, plus the price of Poké Balls increases by $250 Poké Dollars with every gym badge (which makes losing Pokémon more costly).</description></item><item><title>2-on-1 Battles</title><link>http://localhost:1313/mods/pokemon/2-on-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 22:39:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/mods/pokemon/2-on-1/</guid><description>Trainers can use two Pokémon at once, while you can only use one. Essentially, it is a double battle for the opponent but a single battle for you.
For exta difficulty, there is also a version that prevents moves from hitting multiple targets (e.g. Surf, Earthquake).

If your Pokémon actually gets poisoned, it takes double damage.
Unlike regular poison, lead poisoning will also affect Steel- and Poison-type Pokémon.
